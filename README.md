# array_architecture_01
Almost random architecture plans 


Architecture elements are indications of a stable reality, in the same sense a kitchen is the conglomerate of a working method for cooking. 

In that functional sense, if we can explain a behavior we can also predict them. In the workshop we explore mutations, referred as the ability to combine in different ways different architecture units, getting rid of its origin (in this case from an actual residential building). 

What we get is 9 possibilities in which we are aware of the links between those rooms, which we can call nodes of a certain kind of tree (topology). 

We are also aware of the lines from the point of view of a potential observer, which indicates roughly zones of privacy. 

The resulting unit its also reviewed again by making a real solid, so it requires a roofing decision which increases the array of possibilities. 

Those are safe assumptions. 

Yes, because we are toying with only a small sample, we were not rigorous when it mattered to track the changes, cuts, permutations and small decisions to a certain logic. 

If the logic is before these formal changes, we would be more careful in testing. If they only are an afterward consideration, we didn't foresee them (so we left things by chance). 

But in order to track rigorously, we need a system in place. It's simply recognizing the initial units with a grid, identifying (if it is a 2 x 2 grid) positions (1,1  1,2  2,1  2,2) and type of architectural element (wall, aperture) . Of course we can make it more granular and increasing the grid or the types. But sufficient with this. In a formula that depends on grid size and the expected combination (if we are going to use four or five or more units in our result). 

But that permutation answers nothing. We are left on the same dull place. With geometric combinations that are too standard for any tasteful consideration. 

But, the magic might lie in the next step. If we consider architecture as the resulting item of multiple forces, we will arrive at a certain leftover. A waste product that in an initial view could be the same as the other n variations (little difference between each other). But then we change the inputs on the same system. We input our initial drafts and units, with the required imperfections of an original, and then we will have a self contained reference (the dull approach, rigorous but predictable) with the new imperfect plans (variable and lifelike) within the same system. 

Having that thing, that leftover that is akin to the combinatorial, and at the same time unlike in its proposition, we arrive to a set of results. Could be 9 of this subset. And then we pick confidently.
